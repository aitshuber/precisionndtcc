                            <p>Certified welding inspectors work in various industries and include daily duties that are
                                filled with various responsibilities essential to maintaining
                                the safety standards of each specific industry. Certified welding inspectors ensure that
                                all related construction activities follow specific guidelines,
                                in accordance with city, state, and federal safety regulations. They also inspect plans,
                                verify inspection and welding calibrations, and make sure
                                that all welding materials are in proper condition for future projects. Additionally,
                                welding inspectors inspect all welding equipment, such as
                                regulators, cables, and welding machines. During the construction phase, welding
                                inspectors are responsible for monitoring heating values, ensuring
                                the proper temperature controls are being used, and verifying that individuals maintain
                                all compliance issues.)</p>

                        <p>Precision NDT has been a tremendous asset for our company. They're our only call when we need
                            something done. Tony and Stephen are very knowledgeable and are always giving us pointers as
                            to how to make our jobs easier and more efficient when it comes to testing. These guys
                            usually get to us the same day we call them. The reports are usually sent to us the day
                            after the work has been performed. I can't say enough good things about them. Very
                            professional and very dependable.</p>
