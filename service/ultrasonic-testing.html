                            <p>Ultrasonic testing (UT) is a family of non-destructive testing techniques based on the

                                In most common UT applications, very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center
                                frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz, and occasionally up to 50 MHz,
                                are transmitted into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize
                                materials.</p>

                        <p>Precision NDT has been a tremendous asset for our company. They're our only call when we need
                            something done. Tony and Stephen are very knowledgeable and are always giving us pointers as
                            to how to make our jobs easier and more efficient when it comes to testing. These guys
                            usually get to us the same day we call them. The reports are usually sent to us the day
                            after the work has been performed. I can't say enough good things about them. Very
                            professional and very dependable.</p>
