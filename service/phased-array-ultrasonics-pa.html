                            <p>Phased array ultrasonics (PA) is an advanced method of ultrasonic testing that has
                                applications in medical imaging and industrial nondestructive testing.
                                Common applications are to noninvasively examine the heart or to find flaws in
                                manufactured materials such as welds. Single-element (non-phased
                                array) probes, known technically as monolithic probes, emit a beam in a fixed direction.
                                To test or interrogate a large volume of material, a conventional
                                probe must be physically scanned (moved or turned) to sweep the beam through the area of
                                interest. In contrast, the beam from a phased array probe
                                can be focused and swept electronically without moving the probe. The beam is
                                controllable because a phased array probe is made up of multiple
                                small elements, each of which can be pulsed individually at a computer-calculated
                                timing. The term phased refers to the timing, and the term array
                                refers to the multiple elements. Phased array ultrasonic testing is based on principles
                                of wave physics, which also have applications in fields
                                such as optics and electromagnetic antennae.</p>

                        <p>Precision NDT has been a tremendous asset for our company. They're our only call when we need
                            something done. Tony and Stephen are very knowledgeable and are always giving us pointers as
                            to how to make our jobs easier and more efficient when it comes to testing. These guys
                            usually get to us the same day we call them. The reports are usually sent to us the day
                            after the work has been performed. I can't say enough good things about them. Very
                            professional and very dependable.</p>
