                            <p>Magnetic particle Inspection (MPI) is a non-destructive testing (NDT) process for
                                detecting surface and slightly subsurface discontinuities in ferromagnetic
                                materials such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and some of their alloys. The process puts a
                                magnetic field into the part. The piece can be magnetized
                                by direct or indirect magnetization.</p>

                        <p>Precision NDT has been a tremendous asset for our company. They're our only call when we need
                            something done. Tony and Stephen are very knowledgeable and are always giving us pointers as
                            to how to make our jobs easier and more efficient when it comes to testing. These guys
                            usually get to us the same day we call them. The reports are usually sent to us the day
                            after the work has been performed. I can't say enough good things about them. Very
                            professional and very dependable.</p>
